Creative Computing has had many new discoveries in the past years, and new technologies have made a place for themsleves in modern day society and facial recognition is one of them. Over the past ten years facial recognition has rapidly molded itlsef for different uses, unlocking devices, filters and security. Though it may be contrivercial, it is has notibally become a commonly used feature for tech users.

The history of facial recognition actually goes back to the 1960s when Woodrow Wilson, created a system that could classify faces from images. 
A few years after its invention, in 1967, it started getting attention from law enforcement. It proved to be a growing technology since through the 70s, 80s and 90s there were various improvements and in 2001 it was used on the crowds at the Super Bowl. Eventough there was big contriversy, since people felt it violated their rigths and privacy, this technology was not stopped. 



**HOW DOES IT WORK?**

Face detection works with algothirms to identify human faces. These algorithims normally start off by seeking the easiest human feature to detect, the eye. 
After having detected the rest of the face, these details are confirmed through further testings.
To help these algorithms actually confirm that what they are seeing is a human face, they go through training. They are trained through data sets that include thousands of images that contain faces as well as other objects. 

Methods | Use
------------ | -------------
Feature-based| Facial features are used to detect the face.
Knowledge-based | Faces are detected through the rules that are set trough the algorithms.
Template Matching | Images of toher faces are compared to the one being scan to detect that it is, in fact a face.
Appearnace-based | Machine learning and statistical analysis are used to detect the humans features. 

There are different applications for people to develop this technology from the tip of their finger. For example, OpenCV can be used to create face filters that are based on facial recognition technology. 

**HOW CAN FACIAL RECOGNITION BE USEFUL?**

There are various different pros to this new technology we enconter regurarly. Facial recognition add benefits to security, healthcare, and can help law inforcement. Facial recognition security has been used in countless different countries for security, as we can see just as we enter one, at the airport. This type of technology is commonly used at airports or banks because of how precise it is, in fact, the US customs and border Protection, has said they will use facial recognition on 97% of passengers by 2023. It reliablity also reflects on how it is commonly used to identify criminals or even missing people. This technology can help identify people from cctv footage or images, incredibly helpful for investigations. Actually when this era kickstarted in the 2010s, this technology helped identify Obama Bisladen in 2011 and identify thiefs in the US, such as various in Chicago in 2014.

However, facial recognition can also be very contraversial. The most highlighted concern about this technology is its security, and off course, its reliability. For instance, there was a big concern on the precisness of facial recognition technology after the shooting of Geroge Floyd. Due to the fact that the amount of racially motivated police brutality in the US was so high, and most police officers where relying on facial recognition devices, many started to realize it was totally irresponsible to give such power to a device that could be so unreliable. Big companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and IBM, put a stop in selling their technology to law enforcement and not long after that, the UK deemed the use of facial recognition for police forces to be illegal, stating that it contradicted equality and protection laws. 

**DAY TO DAY USES**

- Unlocking devices
- Home security cameras
- Apps and Filters
- Preventing crimes

For general use, facial recognition can be extremly useful and although it is not certain that we can trust it fully, it keeps growing and developing and will keep being part of our modern day society.
